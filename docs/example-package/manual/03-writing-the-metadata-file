# Writing the `metadata.json` File

You may want to look at the [package format documentation](../../packages/gene-package-format.md) for information on what this file should look like.

Let's open the `metadata.json` file in your favorite text editor:
```bash
$EDITOR gene-image/metadata.json
```

Write the following to this file, replacing some of the names:
```json
{
    "geneVersion": "1.0.0",
    "name": "hello-world",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "<<< YOUR NAME HERE >>>",
    "email": "<<< YOUR CONTACT EMAIL HERE >>>",
    "description": "A simple example of a Gene -- Prints Hello, World! to the screen.",
    "longDescription": [
        "Prints the text Hello, World! to the screen.",
        "",
        "This Gene is an example from the Gene documentation."
    ],
    "dependencies": [],
    "conflicts": [],
    "isGPGSigned": false
}
```

After we have added the metadata, let's tell Gene what executables this Gene provides...

Edit the `index.json` file with these contents:
```json
{
    "bin": [
        ["hello-world", "/usr/bin/hello-world"]
    ],
    "lib": [],
    "include": []
}
```

We are done with telling Gene about the package. Let's [learn about Hooks][next_page] before we move on to build the Gene.
